The Friends of Inform 7 extensions group
========================================

Here you'll find many Inform 7 extensions -- some are ready for public use, others are barely working experiments. Enjoy!

If you would access to the repository to add your own extensions, please ask here: http://www.intfiction.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=5229

It may help to know that the I7 Public Library of extensions (integrated with the 6L38 IDE) can be found at:
http://www.emshort.com/pl/payloads/

If you find a bug in any of these extensions, or indeed in any Inform 7 extension at all, please make a new issue and we may be able to help. The purpose of the group is that we can all work together to maintain and develop these extensions. Sharing the load will make it easier on us all, while experienced programmers can help those just starting out.
