"Translation in italian of version 6 of Underside by Eric Eve.

Allows objects to be put under other objects. An underside usually starts out closed so that its contents are hidden from view. Requires Version 7 (or later) of Bulk Limiter; the space under objects is limited by bulk. Underside is compatible with Version 10 or later of Implicit Actions, but does not require it. Version 5 of Underside avoids features deprecated in Version 6E59 of Inform."
