Check an actor mounting (this is the can't mount when mounted on an animal rule): 
	if the actor is carried by a rideable animal (called the steed):

		say "[The actor] monta [the noun]." instead. 

Unsuccessful attempt by someone trying mounting (this is the mounting excuses rule):
	if the reason the action failed is the can't mount when mounted on an animal rule,
		say "[The person asked] sta già montando [the random rideable animal which carries the person asked].";
	if the reason the action failed is the can't mount when mounted on a vehicle rule,
		say "[The person asked] sta già montando [the random rideable vehicle which supports the person asked].";

		say "[The noun] non può essere cavalcato.";

Understand "cavalca [something]" or "cavalca [art-det] [something]" as mounting.

		say "Scendi [da-prep the noun].[line break][run paragraph on]";
