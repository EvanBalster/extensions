Section "Saying Version Numbers without Leading Zeros"

[This override does not affect showmes, but extra zeros in debugging output give no great harm.]

To say (N - a version number):
	let the major version number be N logically shifted 16 bits right;
	let the minor version number be the bitwise and of N logically shifted 8 bits right and 255;
	let the patch level be the bitwise and of N and 255;

Chapter "Responding to Restores" (unindexed)

[A player can save a story under one interpreter and restore under another; we need to resniff (and possibly notify the story) after any restore.]

The resniffing rulebook is a nothing based rulebook.
The when the interpreter changes rulebook is a nothing based rulebook.

To resniff the interpreter after a restore (this is resniffing the interpreter after a restore):
	consider the resniffing rulebook;
	let the old result of Glulx implementation detection be a Glulx implementation;
	let the new result of Glulx implementation detection be a Glulx implementation;
	let the old result of IO implementation detection be an IO implementation;
	let the new result of IO implementation detection be an IO implementation;
	if Glulx implementation already detected is true:
		now the old result of Glulx implementation detection is the cached result of Glulx implementation detection;
		now Glulx implementation already detected is false;
		now the new result of Glulx implementation detection is the current Glulx implementation;
	if IO implementation already detected is true:
		now the old result of IO implementation detection is the cached result of IO implementation detection;
		now IO implementation already detected is false;
		now the new result of IO implementation detection is the current IO implementation;
	unless the old result of Glulx implementation detection is the new result of Glulx implementation detection and the old result of IO implementation detection is the new result of IO implementation detection:
		consider the when the interpreter changes rulebook.

Section "Initial Resniffing" (unindexed)

This is the resniffing stage rule:

The resniffing stage rule is listed before the virtual machine startup rule in the startup rulebook.

Book "Interpreter Tests"

FyreVM, Zoom, and Git/Gift-based interpreter are interpreters.

To decide what interpreter is the current interpreter:
	if the current IO implementation is:
		-- FyreVM channel system:
			decide on FyreVM;
		-- CocoaGlk:
			decide on Zoom; [This is potentially controversial, as the I7 Mac IDE also uses CocoaGlk.]
		-- Unknown Glk implementation:
			if the current Glulx implementation is:
				-- Git/Gift Glulx:
					decide on Git/Gift-based interpreter;
	decide on Unknown interpreter.

Interpreter Sniffing ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

With Interpreter Sniffing included we can determine the interpreter the story is
running under by writing

	the current interpreter

as in

	if the current interpreter is Zoom:
		....

At present, the possibilities are

	FyreVM

	Zoom

	Git/Gift-based interpreter

and

	Unknown interpreter

They all have the kind

	an interpreter

For more detail, we can ask about

	the current Glulx implementation

which has kind

	a Glulx implementation

and the possibilities

	Git/Gift Glulx

	FyreVM Glulx

and

	Unknown Glulx implementation

Likewise, we may wish to know

	the current IO implementation

which has the kind

	an IO implementation

It may be

	FyreVM channel system

	CocoaGlk

	Unknown Glk implementation

or

	Unknown non-Glk implementation

All of these tests have associated phrases to determine corresponding version
numbers:

	the current interpreter version number

	the current Glulx version number

and

	the current IO version number

Each of these decides on a value with the kind

	a version number

which is an arithmetic kind of value written in three parts, major version,
minor version, and patch level, separated by dots.  For example,

	3.1.2

has major version 3, minor version 1, and patch level 2.

With this syntax we can write conditionals like

	if the current Glulx version number is at least 3.1.2:
		....

Finally, it is possible for the interpreter to change mid-story if the player
saves and restores.  If the change can be detected, rules in

	the when the interpreter changes rulebook

will be run; these are written

	When the interpreter changes:
		....

Note that these rules are run as soon as possible, and the story might not have
regained its bearings yet.  (In particular, no Glk recovery has happened.)  It
is generally not safe to produce output within such rules; we should instead
note the differences and respond at a less precarious time, such as before the
next command prompt.

Example: * Fourth Wall - Interpreter information in the story banner and other parts of the story.

	*: "Fourth Wall"
	
	Include Interpreter Sniffing by Friends of I7.
	
	After printing the banner text:
		say "[The current interpreter] [the current interpreter version number][line break]".

	Terp is a room.
	"[A lonely wooden sign] swings from an otherwise bare ceiling, and three of the walls are similarly blank.  Through [the fourth wall], however, you can vaguely make out [the author]."
	
	The ceiling is scenery in the terp.
	The description is "Blank, unstoried."

	Some blank walls are scenery in the terp.
	The description is "Blank, unstoried."
	
	A lonely wooden sign is scenery in the terp.
	The description is "The sign reads '[The current Glulx implementation] [the current Glulx version number]'."
	
	The fourth wall is scenery in the terp.
	Understand "etched" and "surface" as the fourth wall.
	The description of the fourth wall is "Etched on the surface is the text, '[The current IO implementation] [the current IO version number]'."
	Instead of searching the fourth wall:
		try examining the author.
	
	The author is a scenery person in the terp.
	The description is "As best you can tell, [the author] is [the author's name]."
	
	Include (-
		#ifdef Story_Author;
			Constant Author_Name = Story_Author;
		#ifnot;
			Constant Author_Name = (+ "Anonymous" +);
		#endif;
	-) after "Definitions.i6t".
	To decide what text is the author's name: (- Author_Name -).

	Interpreter changed is a truth state that varies; interpreter changed is false.
	When the interpreter changes:
		now interpreter changed is true.
	Before reading a command when interpreter changed is true:
		say "Whoa, déjà vu.  (It happens when they change something.)";
		now interpreter changed is false.
	
	Test me with "x sign / x wall / x author".
